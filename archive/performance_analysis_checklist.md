# Performance & Mobile Analysis Checklist

## Performance Investigation

### Phase 1: Game Engine Analysis
- [ ] Examine Engine.ts for frame rate bottlenecks
- [ ] Check rendering loop efficiency
- [ ] Analyze object creation/destruction patterns
- [ ] Review collision detection algorithms
- [ ] Examine particle system performance
- [ ] Check for memory leaks

### Phase 2: Component Performance
- [ ] Review React component re-rendering
- [ ] Check for unnecessary state updates
- [ ] Analyze CSS animations and transitions
- [ ] Examine image asset loading/optimization
- [ ] Review event handler efficiency

### Phase 3: Mobile Optimization Investigation
- [ ] Analyze current touch/input handling
- [ ] Review responsive design implementation
- [ ] Check button layout and positioning
- [ ] Examine logo image positioning issues
- [ ] Analyze game over screen layout problems

## Mobile Enhancement Plan

### Phase 4: Touch Controls Implementation
- [ ] Design touch control scheme
- [ ] Implement finger tracking
- [ ] Add touch event handlers
- [ ] Test touch responsiveness

### Phase 5: Mobile UI Optimization
- [ ] Hide debug/settings buttons during gameplay on mobile
- [ ] Optimize button placement for mobile
- [ ] Fix logo image positioning
- [ ] Improve game over screen layout
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test performance improvements
- [ ] Validate mobile experience
- [ ] Check cross-device compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
