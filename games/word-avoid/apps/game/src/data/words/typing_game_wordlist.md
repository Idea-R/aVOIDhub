# Typing Game Word Database

## Difficulty Factors Research Summary

Based on typing research, words become harder to type due to:
- **Double letters** (especially with weaker fingers like pinky/ring)
- **Awkward finger combinations** that require crossing or stretching
- **Pinky-heavy words** (weaker finger, prone to errors)
- **Ring finger challenges** (weakest, least independent finger)
- **Row jumping** (frequent movement between keyboard rows)
- **Hand alternation issues** (same hand typing consecutive letters)
- **Unfamiliar letter patterns** (no muscle memory)
